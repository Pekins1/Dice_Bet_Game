Dice Betting Game

This ia my first project in Java which i hava uploaded to github.
This project aims to test the capabilities of the do-while loop syntax.

Logic behind the project.
//......................................................................
Each play through begins with accBalance of 100.0
A bet should be placed
A side for the dice to land on should be selected within a specified range (odds)
A multiplier should be chosen within the given options
A random dice roll is made and compared agains the chosen odd
If it matches the bet is won and the multiplier is calculated against the placed bet the result is added to accBalance.
If it fails the initial bet is deducted from the accBalance.
With each successful play the game ask the user if they whould like to continue.
If yes the game loops to the top asking for a new bet to be placed and if no the ends 
IF the player losses all the initial funds the game ends.
